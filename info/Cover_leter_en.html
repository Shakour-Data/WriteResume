<h1>Cover Letter - Product &amp; Operations Lead at Docsity</h1>

<p>Dear Hiring Team at Docsity,</p>

<p>I am writing to express my interest in the Product &amp; Operations Lead position at Docsity. With over twelve years of experience in designing financial systems, executing algorithmic trading strategies, and managing fintech projects, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your product development and operational success.</p>

<p>My background includes leading the architecture of a Python-based Decision Support System for real-time market-making, developing LSTM-based models for price trend forecasting, and managing cross-functional teams on data-driven trading initiatives. These projects - particularly GravityWaves, my AI-based forecasting platform - demonstrate my ability to translate market data into actionable product features with precision and strategic insight.</p>

<p>Though I am currently based in Iran, I am actively preparing for relocation to Italy, where my sister lives in Turin. Her presence provides a stable and supportive foundation for cultural and logistical integration, ensuring minimal disruption during onboarding. I view this relocation not as a challenge, but as an opportunity to bring global perspective, adaptability, and resilience to your team.</p>

<p>To provide clarity around my professional positioning, I offer the following overview of my candidacy:</p>

<h3>Turning Challenges into Strategic Advantages</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Language</strong>: I am actively investing in Italian language acquisition through daily practice and immersive learning resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Relocation logistics</strong>: With my sister’s presence in Turin and structured planning underway, I expect a smooth transition to Italy.</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of EU experience</strong>: My expertise in emerging markets provides a complementary viewpoint that enriches product strategy.</li>
  <li><strong>Networking</strong>: I plan to accelerate integration into the Italian professional community with the help of personal and industry channels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Docsity’s commitment to meaningful learning and data-powered innovation strongly aligns with my professional values. I am excited to contribute not only technical knowledge but also strategic leadership and international perspective to your team. Thank you for considering my application.</p>

<h3>Innovative Platform Development and Educational Planning</h3>

<p>In addition to my technical expertise, I propose an innovative approach to platform development and educational planning that integrates advanced time management and project control systems with adaptive learning methodologies. This approach combines a growth analytics dashboard, an AI-powered Leitner system for personalized training, and Scrum-based lesson planning to optimize both product development and user learning outcomes.</p>

<p>From my perspective, this project represents an intelligent ecosystem where user behavior, adaptive learning, and performance analytics form a continuous cycle of improvement. The platform links educational planning with spaced repetition, predictive feedback, and growth tracking, enabling learning to evolve responsively to user progress. Study habits inform personalized flashcard optimization, performance data drives forecasting and recommendations, and AI modules feed insights back into planning via an intuitive dashboard. This blend of learning design, automation, and user-centered analytics shows how Docsity can evolve from a content host to an active learning companion.</p>
